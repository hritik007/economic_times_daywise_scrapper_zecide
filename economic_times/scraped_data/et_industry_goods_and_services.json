The cost of each such standardsize handmade paper bag has come down to Rs12.10 after the plastic mix from Rs15.50. This, however, is only a small beginning, said the KVIC chairman. The KVIC is set to launch a more ambitious REPLAN programme \u2014 \u2018Reducing Plastic from Nature\u2019 \u2014 to reduce plastic litter and find ways for its reuse.\n", "\n", "Plans are afoot to involve 2,640 papermaking units in the government sector (including 148 under the KVIC and 2,347 under state KVI boards) to take the mission of plastic reduction further. Each of these 2,640 units will be tasked with producing one lakh handmade paper carry bags. It is estimated that manufacture of 26.4 crore bags will help utilise about 5,280 tonnes of plastic waste \u2014 2 tonnes of plastic waste is used for one lakh bags. The KVIC assesses this would generate local employment of about 26,400 \u2014 labour is needed for collecting the plastic waste as well as for cleaning and helping in processing the waste.\n", "\n", "The commission will enhance the collection remuneration for each collector to Rs9 per kg from the existing Rs7.50. Five new units will also be set up to step up production further. That apart, there are plans for technology transfer. \u201cThere is huge scope for this technology as this material is quite durable. Paper bags and folders are one segment, there is much more possibility of use in the publication industry, where the reinforced paper can be used as the hardbound material, in passbooks of banks and post offices and even for art works,\u201d Saxena pointed out. A beginning has been made with KNHPI recently training 25 youth from Jammu & Kashmir in the technology, in a collaboration with the Indian Army. Five of them are already in the process of setting up their own units back home.\n", "\n", "Mindful of the Prime Minister\u2019s recent exhortation to cut single-use plastic by 2022, Saxena conceded that the KNHPI experiment could not be the one-stop solution to the plastic menace. The intervention stands starkly against the 3.6 million tonnes of plastic waste estimated to be generated in India every year. PET bottles, small plastic articles and poly bags are among the items that do not get recycled at all and enter India\u2019s waterbodies, clog drainage, enter streams and the sea. Along the way, they are consumed by livestock, often with fatal results.\n", "\n", "Saxena thinks that the enormity of the challenge should not stop a small step from attempting a larger footprint. Experiments are already on, therefore, at KHNPI to push up plastic waste content in the material. While currently the KHNPI bags use 20% single-use plastic waste with 80% cotton fabric, experiments are on to take the plastic quotient to 30% in the next bag it churns out.\n", "\n"]], "tags": ["Jaipur", "reusable carry bags", "Modi Cabinet", "knhpi", "Plastic waste", "Kumarappa National Handmade Paper Institute"]},

A 2018 analysis by the United Nations Environment Programme of bans and levies on plastic bags and Styrofoam in 60 countries found that there was not enough data available on their impact in half the cases. In 30 per cent of cases, there was a drop in usage of those products, but in 20 per cent , there was little to no impact. Emails sent to the Environment Ministry did not elicit a response.\n", "\n", " \n", " \n", "A ban would most likely target plastic cutlery, straws, cups and glasses, which, Miranda says, are mostly made by the unorganised segment.

Flipkart did not respond to ET Magazine\u2019s questions nor did Zomato. Besides the most obvious plastic items like bags and cutlery, there is the cigarette butt, which one does not often think of as plastic. The butts have filters made of a plastic called cellulose acetate; this can be recycled by mixing it with other polymers into shipping pallets and benches.\n", "\n", "The cigarette butt is the most commonly found litter on beaches and in rivers and lakes. A global coastal clean-up drive in 2018 found 5.7 million of them. Questions sent to ITC, India\u2019s largest cigarette maker, went unanswered.\n", "\n", " \n", " \n", "Environmental considerations were not a factor in the decision-making of many companies till recently. But chief executives are now being forced by governments, investors, customers and activists to be more responsible. \n", "\n", "\u201cCompanies will have to start thinking of the real cost of products in Rs 1-2 sachets,\u201d says Shah. While those living in slums do not have much of an option in how they discard their waste, companies are taking an informed call on the plastic packaging they use, he adds. However, banning smaller-size packets of chips, chocolates and shampoos means taking those products out of the reach of millions of consumers and giving up a sizeable chunk of the market. Clearly, it\u2019s not an easy choice for companies.\n", "\n", " \n", " \n", "There are efforts underway to make sustainable alternatives commercially viable. The past few years have seen a lot of starch-based substitutes for conventional plastic, but there are still concerns over how long they take to break down once they are discarded. Bamboo-handle toothbrushes and edible seaweed packaging are becoming more popular, but they are still not used at scale. The next few years will likely see some of these products being adopted by the masses, but plastic is very much here to stay.\n", "\n", "While restricting the production and use of some harmful plastics in a phased manner is essential, equally crucial is figuring out how to handle our plastic waste better. When even parts of India\u2019s financial capital, Mumbai, do not segregate dry and wet waste, not much can be said of our smaller cities and towns, which are hardly prepared to handle the surge in refuse.
