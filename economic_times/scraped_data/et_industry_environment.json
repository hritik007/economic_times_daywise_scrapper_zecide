Several theories abound. For one, the Karakoram seems to receive most of its snowfall during winter driven by a meteorological phenomenon called the Westerly Disturbance and not during the summer monsoon as in the rest of the region. Warm summer temperatures affect snowfall in the rest of the Himalayas more, a 2014 study notes, \u201cas temperatures rise above freezing precisely when the majority of precipitation falls\u201d.\n", "\n", "Another study found that a \u201cvortex\u201d of cold air gets trapped in the Karakoram mountains during the summer, countering warming. And another important 2018 study found that irrigation in China, Pakistan, and north India could be increasing snowfall.
