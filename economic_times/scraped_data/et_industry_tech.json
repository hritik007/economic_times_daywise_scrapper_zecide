While, on its surface, it is a battle between two powerful Americans, it can have longlasting effects on how we consume media in India.\n", "\n", "Generally, both in the US and in India, social media companies are not liable for the content that is posted by users under what may be termed as \u201csafe harbour laws\u201d. At the same time, they can take down information without any legal liability, permitting them to police their platforms. It permits them to make choices and indeed such choices may come with political biases. As Stanford Cyber Policy Center\u2019s Daphne Keller has argued, social media platforms should act as \u201cgood Samaritans\u201d, and not be legally obligated to enforce neutrality, since, \u201cby trying to moderate speech\u2026 they will be deemed insufficiently neutral\u201d.\n", "\n", "Such an immunity is not absolute. It rests on compliance \u2014 whether they are taking down posts once notified of the illegality. These principles first developed through legislation and court challenges in the late 1990s and early 2000s and have received global acceptance. In India, this occurred a bit later, with the law being developed till 2015. It has remained somewhat static since then.\n", "\n", "But this law is plainly antiquated. Today, social media platforms are incredibly powerful and ubiquitous. They have upended traditional news media, broadcasting and rewritten how people conduct themselves on a daily basis in nearly every aspect of their lives. It determines national debates, personal habits and can act as the arbiter and source of power. This has led to several nuanced questions which legal scholars and technical experts are still trying to answer. \n", "\n", "For instance, to deal with the problem of disinformation, should platforms self-censor? If yes, in what circumstances? Or, should they maintain a level of neutrality? These obtuse questions around designing regulatory structures for the future of safe harbour protections are what is at the centre of the present debate.\n", "\n", "The specific factual controversy which provides context for this arises from allegations by Trump after two of his tweets on mail-in ballots were \u201cfactchecked\u201d by Twitter, which appended labels, warning users about their accuracy. \n", "\n", "In response, a fuming Trump issued a presidential order on May 28, undermining the protections enjoyed not only by Twitter but other intermediaries as well. This presidential order is broken into eight sections. Eric Goldman, law professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, who analysed it, termed it \u201cpro-censorship political theatre\u201d.\n", "\n", "It increases government power by now providing a questionable legal basis to re-interpret under what actual conditions immunities are available to social media platforms and encourages prosecution against them for political bias. There is emerging consensus that many portions of this executive order would be unenforceable and even susceptible to legal challenge for violating free speech protections under the United States Constitution, as per an analysis by Keller as well as tweets by David Greene, civil liberties director, Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n", "\n", "Closer home, we are facing a somewhat similar moment. This goes above and beyond concerns on political bias or misinformation to diverse arguments made for greater control and content censorship. We have a clumsy draft, termed as Draft Intermediary Rules, that contains provisions that would require automated filtering and heavy-handed censorship.\n", "\n", " They also included provisions for a novel concept termed \u201ctraceability\u201d, which was first evangelised, to my knowledge, on Twitter posts when mob lynchings were linked to WhatsApp forwards. This would have broken end-to-end encryption, which is a much-needed relief to ordinary people who discuss incredibly sensitive information online and made them susceptible to cyber-attacks and mass surveillance.\n", "\n", "Finally, in this complex soup of competing interests, what are some clear takeaways? First, online platforms have immense power and impact on ordinary people, but the prescriptions which are being proposed both in the US and India cater to interests of greater government control. Second, there is a lack of a clear path on regulating online platforms that can account for these disparate harms. \n", "\n", "At present, there are ongoing conversations around the regulatory frameworks of competition law, consumer protection or evolving a whole new regulatory paradigm for such large social media entities that emerge from a \u201cduty of care\u201d principle.

It is reassuring to know that the CCI will scrutinise this mega deal between two data giants before it can be consummated, unlike Facebook\u2019s earlier acquisition of WhatsApp which escaped the CCI\u2019s scrutiny. However, the key question is whether the CCI is equipped to deal with big data issues and if it would, in fact, go beyond its comfort zone (traditional competition rules) to analyse the potential adverse impact of such a mega deal.\n", "\n", "It is no secret that the primary driver of this deal is the vast user and data bases of the parties and the synergies which can be created by judiciously commercialising this data. It is believed that WhatsApp (as a platform with a massive userbase) will be leveraged to propel Reliance\u2019s e-commerce platform, ", "JioMart", ". Given that the deal is subject to the scrutiny of the CCI alone, and that there is no data protection authority to monitor data abuses, it becomes indispensable that the CCI meticulously scrutinises the deal from the big-data perspective, without relying much on the traditional approach which may be unsuitable for dealing with dynamic digital markets.\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "Once upon a time, data was a means to an end and was used for marketing. But, today, data is an end in itself as it carries great value and can be monetized. For example, Facebook paid $19 billion to acquire WhatsApp in 2014 in spite of the latter\u2019s losses of $138 million in 2013. Facebook\u2019s valuation split for WhatsApp was $2.7 billion for its user base, brand value and technology; and $15.3 billion for its \u2018goodwill\u2019. So, effectively, Facebook valued WhatsApp\u2019s data at over $15 billion. This is the value and power of data in today\u2019s world. Given Facebook\u2019s past issues with users\u2019 personal data, concerns around commercialization of personal data without users\u2019 \u2018true\u2019 consent may not be misplaced, especially given the overwhelming number of users of Facebook, WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) and Jio (over 288 million, 400 million and 388 million, respectively). \n", "\n", "At the time of Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp, Jan Koum, WhatsApp\u2019s co-founder, explained how WhatsApp was built with privacy of communication at its core. However, shortly after the acquisition, Koum reportedly left Facebook after his disputes with Facebook over user data issues. He later wrote a blogpost stating that, \u201cIf partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn\u2019t have done it\u201d.\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "Many digital services (including Facebook and WhatsApp) appear to be free to users as users do not pay any money at the time of subscription. However, these services are not truly free, and users pay in terms of their personal data. While subscribing to these services, users are required to accept certain boiler plate terms and conditions which include collection of data on user\u2019s internet activity (in case of Facebook, even activities outside Facebook). This data is then commercialised by sharing it with third parties. Most users whose data is commercialised do not even understand the concept of consent, forget about actually consenting to the collection and commercialisation of their personal data.\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "In this day and age, behavioural advertising has become the new normal. Behavioural advertising is the practice of sending online advertisements to users based on their specific comprehensive profiles by observing their online habits. This enables companies to cut costs by addressing their target audience with customized advertisements for each user.\n", "\n", "To put this in perspective, imagine using your computer locked inside your room browsing something that you do not want anyone to see. However, someone is constantly looking over your shoulder and silently taking notes of what you are viewing. This is what you currently get in the name of data privacy. This is the essence of behavioural advertising which Facebook is far too good at. If you add to this, Jio\u2019s capability as an ISP of monitoring online histories of its users with a dash of deep discounting and a hint of untraceable bias, the results could be far-reaching. \n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "Based on traditional competition rules, it may be difficult to assess the resources and market positions of the combining entities, especially in the technology sector. However, if such an assessment is undertaken considering data as a relevant metric for resources and economic power of the parties, the results would be very different. It is now well accepted that data is an asset and a relevant factor to assess the market power of an entity, especially in the digital space. From previous data driven transactions, such as Facebook/WhatsApp and Microsoft/LinkedIn, competition authorities have learnt their lessons not to ignore the importance of data in competition law assessments despite the limitations of the existing legal framework. \n", "\n", "It is, therefore, critical for the CCI to examine the potential adverse effects of this mega deal before it is consummated and not find comfort in the fact that it has the power to assess the actual conduct of the parties after the combination.

When Krishna took the helm in April, Cortada and current employees hoped the new CEO would use the reorganization to make his mark and be more transparent as IBM enters its third revolution in 108 years. Instead, Krishna, a company veteran, is sticking to the threadbare script.\n", "\n", "IBM spokesman Ed Barbini said the company won\u2019t disclose the total number of dismissals for competitive reasons. \u201cIBM\u2019s work in a highly competitive marketplace requires flexibility to constantly remix to high-value skills, and our workforce decisions are made in the long-term interests of our business,\u201d he wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cRecognizing the unique current conditions, IBM is offering subsidized medical coverage to all affected U.S. employees through June 2021.\u201d\n", "\n", "Many other tech companies disclose how many employees they eliminate. When HP Inc. got a new CEO last year, the PC maker said it would cut as many as 9,000 employees. A few weeks later, Cognizant, an IBM rival, unveiled plans to eliminate up to 7,000 positions. This year, Uber Technologies Inc., Airbnb Inc. and TripAdvisor Inc. disclosed painfully large numbers. \u201cMany companies are firing people today. The more forthright they are about it the better,\u201d said Ronn Torossian, CEO of communications firm 5WPR, which represents many Fortune 500 companies.\n", "\n", "About 90% of the businesses represented by 5WPR disclose a ballpark figure when it comes to large workforce reductions. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think you can fire thousands of people and not answer questions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just the media asking questions -- it\u2019s investors, remaining employees and customers as well.\u201d\n", "\n", "Eliminating employees is always a sensitive topic. That\u2019s especially true for IBM. The company has about 350,000 workers globally, but its domestic workforce has been shrinking while positions have been added in cheaper countries in Asia and Eastern Europe. That exposes the company to criticism and political pressure, especially with President Donald Trump pushing for more American jobs. Still, IBM is not alone in grappling with these disclosure questions. Internal battles often arise between company executives, the human resources department and public relations office over how much information to share on job cuts, said Jonathan Segal, a partner at Duane Morris LLP.

Several impacted employees said they asked their managers how many other colleagues lost their jobs and were told they didn\u2019t have access to that information.\n", "\n", "In online forums and private messaging groups, other former and current IBM employees shared snippets of information. Some posts recounted an executive based in Raleigh, North Carolina, telling staff that 20,000 workers were affected. Others said this is IBM\u2019s biggest staff reduction in a decade. Bruce Baumbush was let go after 22 years with Big Blue. \u201cHalf my department is gone,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThousands of people were impacted.\u201d Watson Health, which offers data-powered medical insights and was once considered an IBM crown jewel, has been \u201cdecimated,\u201d according to Baumbush, who worked in artificial-intelligence consulting.\n", "\n", "Employees in at least eight different states were dismissed, according to interviews with affected IBM workers. Entire teams were cut from the broader Watson business, including managers, these people said. They asked not to be identified discussing sensitive company issues. Under federal law, corporations must notify regional Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification offices about plans to cut jobs, but there\u2019s a lot of leeway for companies to avoid WARN filings.\n", "\n", "IBM dismissed 243 employees at three work sites in Costa Mesa and San Jose recently, according to California\u2019s WARN office.
